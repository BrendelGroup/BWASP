And, of course,\r\nour software should be _ramose_ (\"having many branches\") - it's yours to use,\r\nmodify, improve, enhance, ... .\r\n\r\nTo proceed, please follow the instructions in the [INSTALL](./INSTALL.md)\r\ndocument.  Once all preparatory steps are taken care of, see the\r\n[HOWTO](./HOWTO.md) document\r\n\r\n## Reference\r\n\r\nAmy L. Toth, Saranya Sankaranarayanan, and Volker P. Brendel (2016) _Estimating\r\nthe size and dynamics of the CpG methylome of social insects._ To be submitted.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nPlease direct all comments and suggestions to\r\n[Volker Brendel](<mailto:vbrendel@indiana.edu>)\r\nat [Indiana University](http://brendelgroup.org/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
