# BWASP
Bisulfite-seq data Workflow Automation Software and Protocols

The BWASP repository encompasses code we developed in the [Brendel Group](http://brendelgroup.org/) for scalable, reproducible analyses of bisulfite sequencing data.

## Getting Started

The __BWASP__ package conforms to our [RAMOSE](https://brendelgroup.github.io/)
philosophy and promise: it should generate __reproducible__, __accurate__, and
__meaningful__ results; it is __open__ (source) and designed to be __scalable__
and __easy__ to use.

To proceed, please follow the instructions in the [INSTALL](./INSTALL.md)
document.  Once all preparatory steps are taken care of, see the
[HOWTO](./HOWTO.md) document
